            <div>The storyline of One Piece—manga and anime alike—is commonly divided into individual story arcs for easier understanding. 
                While the exact divisions are somewhat fluid, 
                it is generally understood that an arc begins when the Straw Hat Pirates land on a specific island, 
                and ends when they leave.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                Most if not all story arcs are grouped into larger sagas, 
                which tend to reflect goals and/or enemies that the Straw Hats pursue across multiple islands.

                            This is where he recruits most of his crew and, ultimately, where the adventure begins.

                            This sparked the Golden Age of Pirates in which countless pirates raise their flags and set off to find One Piece.</div>
